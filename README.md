# AI-Powered-Medical-Chatbot-using-Hugging-Face-Transformers
üìù Description

This project demonstrates how to build a medical AI chatbot by fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) with Hugging Face. The model is trained on domain-specific medical data to provide context-aware answers to health-related queries.

Key Features:

Fine-tunes a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) on medical Q&A datasets.

Implements data preprocessing, tokenization, and model optimization.

Provides an interactive chatbot interface for asking medical questions.

Can be extended to applications such as symptom checking, preliminary diagnosis support, or medical FAQ automation.
